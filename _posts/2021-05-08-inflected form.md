## Inflected Form
A wordâ€™s form reflects syntactic and semantic features that are expressed by the word. For example, each English count noun has both singular and plural forms (robot/robots, process/processes), known as the inflected forms of the noun. 
 
 NLP systems must be able to analyze and generate all of these inflected forms. Fortunately, inflected forms tend to be systematically related to one another. This is why English speakers can usually predict the singular form from the plural and vice-versa, even for words they have never seen before.
 
 In this assignment, you will design a model that learns to generate morphological inflections from a lemma and a set of morphosyntactic features of the target form.
